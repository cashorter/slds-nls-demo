# Mississippi SLDS AI Demo

This is a natural language search demo that mimics the Mississippi SLDS homepage but uses Gemini to answer open-ended queries.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo or download as zip.
2. Open `script.js` and replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual key.
3. Open `index.html` in a browser.

## Example Questions

- "What are the top reasons for student transfers in Mississippi?"
- "Show me dropout trends since 2019 by region."
- "Compare ACT scores across regions since 2019."

## Demo Mode

Set `useMockResults = true` in `script.js` to simulate offline mode.
